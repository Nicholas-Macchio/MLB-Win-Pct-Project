This is my final project from my first year during my masters program.
Below is the rubric required for this project:

Final project – Business Analytics – Nick Macchio
Utilize Python to perform a descriptive analysis of a business dataset. Write a report that describes the following:
1. Define the problem: What is the business problem that you are attempting to solve. Why is Python a good way to solve this problem?
2. Describe the dataset:
a. How many variables are in the data set?
b. What are the data types and levels of measurement for each of the variables?
c. How many observations are in the data set?
d. Are there any missing values or outliers in the data set?
e. How did you choose to handle the missing values and outliers?
f. What are some of the descriptive statistics for key variables?
4.
a. Make sure to include not only summary statistics for individual variables, but also descriptive statistics that may reveal potential relationships between variables for both quantitative and categorical variables.
b. Descriptive statistics should be presented in a meaningful manner. For example, don’t just list a bunch of means. Tell us what the mean of a variable tells us about the data and include other metrics to measure values for that variable to show dispersion and distribution shape.
c. Create data visualizations for variables in the data set.
5. What do the descriptive statistics and visualizations that were created tell us about the data set? How can we use the results to “tell a story” about the data? What are the key findings and conclusions that you could present to the business to help answer their questions about the data from Part #1?
6. Code to solve the problem: Please copy/paste all Python code to solve the problem into a section of the document. Code should be commented to explain steps taken.
7. Results: What did you learn about the data? Describe how this exercise helped you become a better data analyst. What would you do differently? What were the biggest challenges when working with the data. Why is or isn’t Python a good tool to use for this type of analysis?
